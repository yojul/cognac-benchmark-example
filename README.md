## Cognac Benchmark Example

**Simple implementation of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for benchmarking purposes on [ðŸ¥ƒCOGNAC](https://github.com/yojul/cognac) network environments.**

[COGNAC](https://github.com/yojul/cognac) is a collection of MARL environment with network structure.

---

## Features

* **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for quick setup.
* **Modular**: Easy-to-extend structure for adding new algorithms or environments.
* **Benchmark-ready**: Standardized scripts to evaluate and compare MARL performance.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.12 or above
* `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yojul/cognac-benchmark-example.git
   cd cognac-benchmark-example
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running Experiments

All benchmark scripts are located in the `algos/` directory. They are directly adapted from [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) implementations and coded as self-contained single file implementation of standard MARL algorithms. To run a standard experiment:
All hyperparameters should be directly specified within the python file in the **_Args_** section.

```bash
python algos/benchmark_ippo.py
```
